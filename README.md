**Hi my name is Cristian Hernandez :wave:**

Currently I'm an EE student at CSULA and specializing in computer engineering.
I'm interested in learning about coding in python and seeing what new types of 
technology are being devloped in the world today.
As of right now, I'm entering my first semester as a graduate student and 
I'm taking pretty interesting classes this semester.

Besides school, a few of my hobbies include:
- Watching Football :football: and Basketball :basketball:
- Playing Video Games :video_game:
- Working out
- Eating
