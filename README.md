**Hi my name is Cristian Hernandez :wave:**

Currently I'm an EE student at CSULA and specializing in computer engineering.
I'm interested in learning about coding in python and seeing what new types of 
technology are being devloped in the world today.
As of right now, I'm working on my senior design project that is an
autonomus acrobatic robot, that swings and should perform a backflip.
Hopefully, I'm able to have this project done by May and can show my work.

Besides school, a few of my hobbies include:
- Watching Football :football: and Basketball :basketball:
- Playing Video Games :video_game:
- Working out
- Eating
